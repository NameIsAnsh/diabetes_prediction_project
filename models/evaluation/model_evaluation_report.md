## Conclusion

The model demonstrates good performance in predicting diabetes risk, with an F1 score of 0.5935 and AUC of 0.7849. The precision-recall tradeoff is balanced, making the model suitable for screening purposes.

However, there is room for improvement, particularly in reducing false negatives, which are critical in a medical context. Future work could focus on collecting more data, exploring additional features, or implementing ensemble methods to further improve model performance.
