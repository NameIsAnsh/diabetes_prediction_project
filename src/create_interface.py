    ## Welcome to the Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool
    
    This application uses machine learning to predict the risk of diabetes based on several health indicators.
    
    ### How to use this tool:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Prediction Tool** page using the sidebar
    2. Enter your health information
    3. Click "Predict" to see your diabetes risk assessment
    4. Review the results and recommendations
    
    ### About Diabetes
    
    Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. 
    If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use the insulin it makes as well as it should.
    
    Early detection and management of diabetes can prevent complications and improve quality of life.
    
    ### Dataset Information
    
    This prediction model was trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, which includes health metrics from female patients of Pima Indian heritage.

    ### Key Risk Factors
    
    Based on our analysis, the following factors have the strongest correlation with diabetes risk:
    
    1. **Glucose Level**: Higher blood glucose levels are strongly associated with diabetes
    2. **BMI (Body Mass Index)**: Higher BMI values indicate increased risk
    3. **Age**: Risk increases with age
    4. **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Family history of diabetes increases risk
    5. **Number of Pregnancies**: More pregnancies are associated with higher risk in this dataset
    
    Use the prediction tool to assess your personal risk based on these and other factors.
